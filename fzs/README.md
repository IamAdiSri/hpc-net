# Flow Zone Switching

Flow-Zone Switching (FZS) is a loop-free location-based source-routing solution that eliminates the need for forwarding tables by embedding routing instructions and flow identifiers directly in the flow-zone software-defined address (SDA).
This repository contains a P4 implementation of FZS and a simple datacenter topology created in mininet for validation testing.
